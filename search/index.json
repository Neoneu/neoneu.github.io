[{"content":"Introduction By the end of 1941, most of continental Europe had fallen to Nazi Germany and the other Axis powers, and by 1942, their forces had begun their significant advance in the eastern front deep into the Soviet Union. A key component of their rapid conquests was their revolutionary use of tanks in modern warfare. While other militaries, most notably that of France, used tanks as a modern armored form of cavalry, the Germans were the first to make full use of tanks’ speed and strength.\nWith the Nazis utilizing tanks with such devastating results, it was essential for the Allies to stop them. A key component of the solution was figuring out how many tanks the Germans had deployed in order to allocate resources effectively, since there was a tremendous danger both in underestimating and in overestimating the enemy’s strength. The consequence of underestimating is clear, since one could suddenly be outnumbered in battle. Overestimating is also bad, since it can lead to undue caution and failure to exploit advantages, or to committing too many resources in one theater and thus not having enough elsewhere. The Allies realized that the tanks destroyed and captured during a battle had serial numbers on their gearboxes that could help with this problem. With these data, the Allies found a statistical method to estimate the numbers of the tanks.\nMethods Now we gonna focus on searching for a good estimator for the numbers of the tanks. But before we start calculation, we should first clarify our criterion, that is, what properties are \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;? An intuitive idea is to find an unbiased estimator with as small variance as possible, and that is exactly what I\u0026rsquo;d pursue here. Then we may assume some key information for a deeper analysis. Suppose that Germany had $N$ tanks in total, and that the Allies observed $k$ tanks. Let the numbers of observed tanks be $x_{(1)},x_{(2)},\\dots,x_{(k)}$ and $x_{(1)}\u0026lt;x_{(2)}\u0026lt;\\dots\u0026lt;x_{(k)}$. What\u0026rsquo;s more, each tank has an equal chance of being observed. Our goal is to find $\\widehat{N}$, which is an estimator of $N$.\nMethod I If we consider the numbers of observed tanks as a set of random variables $X_{(1)},X_{(2)},\\dots,X_{(k)}$ ($X_{(1)}\u0026lt;X_{(2)}\u0026lt;\\dots\u0026lt;X_{(k)}$), and $x_{(1)},x_{(2)},\\dots,x_{(k)}$ as their observations, then we have $$ \\Pr(X_{(k)}=x_{(k)})=\\frac{x_{(k)}-1\\choose k-1}{N \\choose k}. $$ So $$ \\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)})=\\sum_{m=k}^{N}m\\Pr(X_{(k)}=m)=\\sum_{m=k}^{N}m\\frac{m-1\\choose k-1}{N \\choose k} =k\\sum_{m=k}^{N}\\frac{m\\choose k}{N \\choose k}=\\frac{k(N+1)}{k+1}, $$ $$ \\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)}^2)=\\sum_{m=k}^{N}m^2\\frac{m-1\\choose k-1}{N \\choose k}= \\sum_{m=k}^{N}(m+1)m\\frac{m-1\\choose k-1}{N \\choose k}-\\sum_{m=k}^{N}m\\frac{m-1\\choose k-1}{N \\choose k} =\\frac{k(N+1)(N+2)}{k+2}. $$ Here we use a trick, that is $\\sum_{m=k}^N {m\\choose k}={N+1\\choose k+1}$. The fomula can be proven by induction. Rearranging the equation, we have $$ N=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)})-1. $$ So the point estimation of $N$ is $$ \\widehat{N}=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)X_{(k)}-1. $$ Let\u0026rsquo;s check some properties of the estimator, $$ \\mathbb{E}(\\widehat{N})=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)})-1=N, $$\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{var}(\\widehat{N})\u0026=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^2\\mathrm{var}(X_{(k)})\\\\ \u0026=\\left(1+\\frac{1}{k}\\right)^2\\left(\\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)}^2)-\\left(\\mathbb{E}(X_{(k)})\\right)^2\\right)\\\\ \u0026=\\frac{(N-k)(N+1)}{k(k+2)}. \\end{aligned} \\] When $k\\ll N$, the standard error of $\\widehat{N}$ approximately equals to $N/k$. If the Allies observed more tanks, then the standard error will decrease rapidly. The fact is in accord with our intuition. Since we have only one observation of the random variable $X_{(k)}$, the result is satisfactory.

The Riemann integral is based on the Jordan measure, and defined by taking a limit of a Riemann sum, which is quite intuitive and easy to calculate, making it widely used in almost every aspect of modern science. However, it is not always good enough to satisfy mathematician. Since rational numbers is countable, we may arrange them as $r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_k,\\dots$ For example, we can arrange them as following: Consider such a sequence \\(\\{f_k\\}_{n=1}^\\infty\\) where \\[ f_k(x)=\\begin{cases} 1,\u0026amp;x\\in\\{r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_k\\}\\\\ 0,\u0026amp;else \\end{cases} \\] Obviously for any $k\\in\\mathbb{N}^+$, $f_k$ is Riemann integrable and $f_k$ increases to the Dirichlet function \\[ f(x)=\\begin{cases} 1,\u0026amp;x\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\\\ 0,\u0026amp;else \\end{cases} \\] However, the Dirichlet function is not Riemann integrable. Thus we come to the conclusion that the class of functions which are Riemann integrable is not complete. Then Lebesgue integral is developed to solve this problem. The book consists of 7 chapters, but here I\u0026rsquo;ll just share my notes of the first three chpaters. Briefly, first we need to be familiar with some basic conclusions and common techniques in measure theory. Then we will construct the Lebesgue integral step by step and gain some useful conclusion like Fatou\u0026rsquo;s lemma and dominant convergence theorem. Finally, we will discuss differentiation under Lebesgue integral. As for the last 4 chapters, I plan to skip it and use Folland\u0026rsquo;s Real Analysis instead to complete the whole framework.

Stein\nAnalysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with continuous functions, limits, and related theories, such as differentiation, integration, measure, infinite sequences, series, and analytic functions. The subject is such a huge topic that it is scarcely possible for one to contain all the details in it. Therefore, it is important for one to find a proper way to start the journey into this unfathomable palace. Fortunately, Terence Tao blaze a trail in this topic, beginning with the most intuitive knowledge for human beings - the natural numbers, and then constructing the edifice of analysis step by step. There are two books in this series, and my note of this series covers the contents up to the Riemann integral.

The ballet was premiered at Christmastime in 1892, and has since been one of the most popular ballets in the world. It is based on E. T. A Hoffmann’s 1816 fairytale The Nutcracker and The Mouse King, which tells the story of a young girl who adventures into the ‘Land of Sweets’ on Christmas Eve.\nUndoubtedly, it is a challenge to play such a piece of orchestral music on a single guitar, since some details will inevitably be lost. However, I just love this piece so much that I can\u0026rsquo;t help myself trying to figure out the whole piece on my own guitar. Fortunately, I finally created its guitar tablature.
